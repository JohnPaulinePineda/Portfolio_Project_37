Chronic disease indicators are a set of surveillance indicators developed by consensus among the Center for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC), Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and National Association of Chronic Disease Directors (NACDD). CDI enables public health professionals and policymakers to retrieve uniformly defined state-level data for chronic diseases and risk factors that have a substantial impact on public health. These indicators are essential for surveillance, prioritization, and evaluation of public health interventions. This [case study](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_37/) aims to explore and validate potential underlying factor structures and relationships among a set of observed US chronic disease indicators by identifying latent factors that explain the observed correlations and reducing the complexity of the data by grouping related indicators together under these discovered factors. Data quality evaluation and correlation adequacy assessment were conducted on the initial dataset to identify and remove cases or variables noted with irregularities, in addition to the subsequent preprocessing operations most suitable for the downstream analysis. Multiple Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) model structures with various parameter combinations were formulated considering different Factor Extraction and Factor Rotation methods. The best models were determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and High Residual Rate performance metrics. All candidate models were additionally compared based on the contexts presented by the derived latent factors including their loadings and correlations. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to validate the hypothesized factor model structures applying the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), and Standardized Root Mean Square Error of the Residual (SRMR) performance metrics. In addition to assessing the model fit, alignment of the factor loadings and latent factor correlations with theoretical expectations was evaluated. Post-hoc exploration of the model results to provide insights on the importance, contribution, and effect of the various underlying constructs to the observed indicators involved EFA Dandelion Plot and CFA Path Diagram methods.
